ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Van (@vanngo-okta).

ğŸ‘€ I'm curious of how big data is processed. Currently, I'm taking a course on machine learning...hoping to wrap it up soon!
In the winter months, I knit and crochet - making way too many scarfs, toques, and mittens for my family. 
When the weather is warmer, I enjoy hiking in park trails.ğŸŒ±
